# EV 150 kW-class IPM/SPM Motor – Kalman-Filter-Based Flux/EMF Estimation Literature

Below is a table of literature (in English or Japanese) on **flux or induced-voltage (back-EMF) estimation for torque compensation under motor temperature changes** in \~150 kW-class IPM/SPM EV motors, using Kalman filters (including extended Kalman filters). The table prioritizes works with experimental validation (1) and then theory-focused works (2). Each entry lists the motor type, what is estimated (flux or EMF), the Kalman filter variant, whether experiments were done, publication year, venue, a brief summary, and a link if available.

The approach leverages the response to HF voltage injection and uses a combined PF/KF observer to track magnet flux linkage drop due to heating. Tested experimentally, showing effective non-intrusive magnet temperature monitoring under actual drive conditions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                   |

The estimated saturation effects are fed into the flux estimator, improving accuracy under varying magnet & core conditions. Observability and stability are analyzed. **Simulation and experimental results** show the observer can **accurately estimate flux linkage and compensate torque errors** even as inductances change with saturation.                                                                                                        |                   |

Discusses poor observability at low speed and introduces a low-speed thermal drift estimator. Also evaluates an **EKF with inductance estimation** (to handle model uncertainty) and noise adaptive tuning. Simulation results show the EKF greatly improves temperature accuracy (error \~2.5°C vs \~11°C with basic KF). A brief test on a real motor yielded worst-case errors \~12°C, highlighting sensitivity to model accuracy and the need for further experimental validation. |                   |

Unlike conventional observers that assume constant flux, the proposed **EKF/UKF observers include the PM flux linkage and load torque as states**, so they can estimate flux online and avoid sensitivity to flux uncertainty. Nonlinear observability of the models is analyzed. Simulation results compare the proposed EKF/UKF against traditional estimators under flux-change scenarios, and real-time tests assess computational load. The method achieves accurate position and torque estimation even as magnet flux changes, with manageable CPU burden.                        |                   |
